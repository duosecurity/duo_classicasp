# Overview

**duo_classicasp** - Duo two-factor authentication for Classic ASP web applications

Duo provides simple two-factor authentication as a service via:

1.  Phone callback
2.  SMS-delivered one-time passcodes
3.  Duo mobile app to generate one-time passcodes
4.  Duo mobile app for smartphone push authentication
5.  Duo hardware token to generate one-time passcodes

This package allows a web developer to quickly add Duo's interactive, self-service, two-factor authentication to any web login form - without setting up secondary user accounts, directory synchronization, servers, or hardware.

What's here:

* `js` - Duo Javascript library, to be hosted by your webserver.
* `duo.wsc` - Duo Classic ASP SDK to be integrated with your web application
* `test.asp` -  Unit tests for our SDK
